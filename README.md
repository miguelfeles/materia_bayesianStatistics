# Bayesian Statistics Repository 
En pausa - se retoma en enero

Welcome to the Bayesian Statistics Repository! This project is dedicated to providing notes, examples, and code snippets to help understand and implement Bayesian statistical methods. Whether you're a student, a professional, or just curious about Bayesian statistics, you'll find valuable resources here.


## Introduction

Bayesian statistics is a subset of statistics in which probability expresses a degree of belief in an event. This belief may change as new evidence is presented. Bayesian statistics uses Bayes' theorem to update the probability of a hypothesis as more evidence or information becomes available.


This repository aims to simplify Bayesian concepts through comprehensive notes and practical examples.

## Contents

- `Introduction to Bayesian Statistics` - A document that outlines the fundamentals of Bayesian statistics, including key concepts and terminologies.
- `Bayesian Inference` - Notes and examples on how Bayesian inference works and its applications.
- `Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) Techniques` - A guide to MCMC methods for sampling from probability distributions.
- `Case Studies` - Real-world applications of Bayesian methods in various fields.
- `Code Snippets` - Python/R code snippets demonstrating how to implement Bayesian statistical models.

## Getting Started

To get started with this repository:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using `git clone https://github.com/miguelfeles/estadisticaBayesiana.git`
2. Navigate to the `Introduction to Bayesian Statistics` document to build a foundational understanding.
3. Explore the `Code Snippets` folder to see Bayesian statistics in action.
4. Check out the `Case Studies` for real-world applications of the methods discussed.
